<h1>Develop Data Pipeline for Hydrological Data Project (2024)/h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I successfully conceptualized, developed, executed, and documented a data pipeline in Python for the Water Protection and Sustainability Branch, Ministry of Water, Land, and Resource Stewardship. I defined data requirements, selected appropriate tools and modules, and built and tested the data pipeline. The pipeline extracts data from multiple sources and creates four feature classes that show the locations of drinking water systems (e.g., wells and aquifers) according to criteria stipulated in the BC Drinking Water Protection Act. The script is set to run in Jenkins and automatically updates datasets in a data warehouse.<br />

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Visual Studio Code</b> (21H2)


<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

I included screenshots of sections of the code below. 

This was an interesting project because of the schema specifications that were stipulated by the client. I had to come with some creative pieces of code to fulfill the requirements.  <br />
